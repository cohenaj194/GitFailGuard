Certainly! Below is a Python script that uses the OpenAI API to analyze a screenshot based on a user-provided prompt. The script extracts text from the image using OCR (Optical Character Recognition) with the `pytesseract` library and then sends this text to the OpenAI API along with your custom prompt for analysis.

### Prerequisites

1. **Install Tesseract OCR Engine**:

   - **Ubuntu/Debian**:
     ```bash
     sudo apt-get install tesseract-ocr
     ```
   - **macOS (using Homebrew)**:
     ```bash
     brew install tesseract
     ```
   - **Windows**:
     Download the installer from [Tesseract OCR GitHub](https://github.com/UB-Mannheim/tesseract/wiki) and follow the installation instructions.

2. **Install Required Python Packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install pytesseract Pillow openai
   ```

3. **Set Your OpenAI API Key**:

   - Obtain your API key from [OpenAI](https://platform.openai.com/account/api-keys).
   - Set the `OPENAI_API_KEY` environment variable in your terminal:

     - **For Unix/Linux/Mac**:
       ```bash
       export OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
       ```
     - **For Windows CMD**:
       ```cmd
       set OPENAI_API_KEY=your-api-key-here
       ```
     - **For Windows PowerShell**:
       ```powershell
       $env:OPENAI_API_KEY='your-api-key-here'
       ```

### Usage

Run the script from the command line:

```bash
python analyze_screenshot.py path/to/your/screenshot.png "Your custom prompt here"
```

**Example**:

```bash
python analyze_screenshot.py screenshot.png "Summarize the key points from the following text and identify any action items."
```

### Explanation

- **extract_text_from_image**: Opens the image file and uses `pytesseract` to perform OCR, extracting any text found in the image.
- **analyze_text_with_llm**: Sends the extracted text along with your custom prompt to the OpenAI API for analysis.
- **main**: Handles command-line arguments, orchestrates the text extraction and analysis process, and outputs the result.

### Notes

- **Image Content Limitations**: This script focuses on extracting and analyzing text from images. If your screenshot contains significant graphical data (like charts or images without text), additional image processing would be required.
- **OpenAI API Costs**: Be aware of the API usage costs associated with OpenAI. Monitor your usage in your OpenAI account to avoid unexpected charges.
- **Error Handling**: The script includes basic error handling for issues like missing API keys, problems opening the image file, and API request errors.

### Customization

- **Changing the Model**: If you have access to GPT-4, you can change the model in the `analyze_text_with_llm` function:
  ```python
  response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
      model="gpt-4",
      ...
  )
  ```
- **Adjusting Parameters**: Modify `max_tokens`, `temperature`, and other parameters in the `openai.ChatCompletion.create` call to fine-tune the responses.

### Additional Tips

- **Handling Multi-word Prompts**: If your custom prompt contains spaces, enclose it in quotes when running the script.
- **Non-Textual Analysis**: For analyzing images that contain more than just text (like diagrams or photos), consider integrating image recognition models such as those provided by OpenAI's Vision API or other computer vision libraries.

By following these steps, you should be able to analyze screenshots using a Python script and an LLM API, with the flexibility to change the prompt as needed.
